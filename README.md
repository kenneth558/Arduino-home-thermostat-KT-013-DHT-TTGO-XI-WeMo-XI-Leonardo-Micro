# Arduino-home-thermostat-KT-013-DHT-TTGO-XI-WeMo-XI-Leonardo-Micro-Y-n
Abbreviated for boards not able to hold all enhancements but needing KY-013 &amp;/or DHT with calibration.  Removed thermostat "auto" mode to make room while retaining "heat", "cool", and "off" modes.

If the ability to use KT-013 with calibration is more important to your application than the "auto" thermostat mode, this version will fit in boards with too little flash to hold both features together.  DHT11 and DHT22 are still supported.  Read version v.0.9 README.md for full info.
